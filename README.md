# Giphy-API

This is the Giphy-API Project

It was completed for the Sixth Homework Assignment for the Coding Boot Camp

It displays a series of buttons with the names of Superheroes as well as a text input box to take in the name of any hero the user wishes to enter.

If one of the buttons is clicked, a sequence of 10 .gifs of the hero will display below the buttons and input box. Each .gif will dispolay in a still image state and only begin looping once it has been clicked. It will return to a static image state if it is clicked once more.

If the user types into the input box and clicks the "add a hero" button, a new button with a name taken from the user input will be displayed. It will function identically to the previous buttons. This button adding feature can be completed an infinite number of times.
